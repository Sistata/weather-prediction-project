# Weather Prediction with Python and Machine Learning

The purpose of this project is to predict the temperature using the historical data. The local weather dataset was downloaded from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A system was built by cleaning the data and using the ridge regression to make the historical prediction. In order to improve the model, more predictors were added.
